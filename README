This was a project I made for a C++ intro to programming class.
All code was made and designed by me.

It is a connect four type game.
You place letters into a grid and attempt to spell words.
Words of three to seven give you points.



Tour of the files
design.txt
	This was my finishing design that I had for the project.
	Points out where my project ended up moving away from it somewhat.

src directory
    As usually all the code is here.  Just type 'make'
    How to run the game:
    thegame dictionaryfile <opt testingfile>

    A dictionary file named 'words' is supplied to use as default.

test directory
     This is where all my tests were created.
     To use the tests you can type
     jtest #
     Where # is the test number.

     The lists of tests used can be seen in 'testSpect.txt'

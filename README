This was a project I made for a C++ intro to programming class.
All code was written and designed by me alone.  The professor
had a very specific specification on the output and input.

The game plays like connect four(tm) except letters are dropped instead.
To score points, words of three to sevven letters are to be spelled.
The game is played versus a computer opponent.  Human turn is first.
A grid is then shown with the letters able to be played.
At start each player is given one of each except vowels which they recieve two.
The game will end with letters still remaining.



Tour of the files
design.txt
	This was my finishing design that I had for the project.
	Points out where my project ended up moving away from it somewhat.

src directory
    As usually all the code is here.  Just type 'make'
    How to run the game:
    thegame dictionaryfile <opt testingfile>

    A dictionary file named 'words' is supplied to use as default.

test directory
     This is where all my tests were created.
     To use the tests you can type
     jtest #
     Where # is the test number.

     The lists of tests used can be seen in 'testSpect.txt'

#######HOW TO RUN TESTS#################
To excute a test you type
'jtest #'
Where # is the test number you want to run

This can be done in the test or src directory

Under the list of test cases.
Ex. is then followed by at least one example in test files

********Functional Converage.*********

All tests are broken up into testing the Computer, Player, Game Flow
It's based on how the classes are organized in the code for easy error testing.

###Testing Human Player### -
